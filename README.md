# HeadingsFormatter-Markdown
A simple script to automatically format headings for markdown files

When using obsidian primary headings used to be too large for my liking, after 2 years of taking notes, each markdown file I had in Obsidian would have a different heading hierarchy, this script rearranges these headings such that the style is uniform for all markdown files.

Simply place script in the desired parent directory and run it, make sure to backup markdown files first.
