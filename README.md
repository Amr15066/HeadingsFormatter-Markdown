# HeadingsFormatter-Markdown
A simple script to automatically format headings for markdown files

When using obsidian primary headings used to be too large for my liking, after 2 years of taking notes, each markdown file I had in Obsidian would have a different heading hierarchy, this script rearranges these headings such that the style is uniform for all markdown files.
